<p>
  After completion of the B. Tech Programme, student will develop:
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>1. Engineering Knowledge:</b> Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering
  fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering
  problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Problem Analysis: </b>Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyse complex
  engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics,
  natural sciences and engineering sciences.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>3. Design/Development of Solutions:</b> Design solutions for complex engineering problems and
  design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate
  consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental
  considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>4. Conduct Investigations of Complex Problems:</b> Use research-based knowledge and research
  methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of
  the information to provide valid conclusions for complex problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>5. Modern Tool Usage:</b> Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern
  engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities
  with an understanding of the limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>6. The Engineer and Society:</b> Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess
  societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to
  the professional engineering practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>7. Environment and Sustainability: </b>Understand the impact of the professional engineering
  solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need
  for sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>8. Ethics:</b> Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and
  norms of the engineering practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>9. Individual and Team Work: </b>Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader
  in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>10. Communication:</b> Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the
  engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write
  effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive
  clear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>11. Project Management and Finance:</b> Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the
  engineering and management principles and apply these to oneâ€™s own work, as a member and
  leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>12. Life-long Learning:</b> Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in
  independent and lifelong learning in the broadest context of techno</p>
